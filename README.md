# Give Me A Sniglet!

Give Me a Sniglet is a random word-like generator with an on-device machine learning model that validates whether the
word is likely to be valid. Generate a set of words and view various confidence score, and copy them to your clipboard
with a single tap. Customize the algorithm by changing the size of the words and syllable shapes.
